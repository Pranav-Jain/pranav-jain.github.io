								<h2>Abstract</h2>
								<p>
									The idea of using a neural network to represent continuous vector
									fields (i.e., neural fields) has become popular for solving PDEs
									arising from physics simulations. Here, the classical spatial discretization
									(e.g., finite difference) of PDE solvers is replaced with a
									neural network that models a differentiable function, so the spatial
									gradients of the PDEs can be readily computed via autodifferentiation.
									When used in fluid simulation, however, neural fields fail
									to capture many important phenomena, such as the vortex shedding
									experienced in the von Kármán vortex street experiment. We
									present a novel neural network representation for fluid simulation
									that augments neural fields with explicitly enforced boundary
									conditions as well as a Monte Carlo pressure solver to get rid of
									all weakly enforced boundary conditions. Our method, the Neural
									Monte Carlo method (NMC), is completely mesh-free, i.e., it doesn’t
									depend on any grid-based discretization. While NMC does not
									achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy of the well-established gridbased
									methods, it significantly outperforms previous mesh-free
									neural fluid methods on fluid flows involving intricate boundaries
									and turbulence regimes.
